    <p><b>Masjid Rehman Policy Statement – Use of Facilities:</b></p>
    <p>Masjid Rehman is dedicated to serving the religious, social and educational needs of the local Muslim American
        community in accordance with the Qur’an and Sunnah. The Masjid is considered house of Allah and therefore its
        facilities are available to every Muslim. However, it is owned and administered by MR which is the primary
        entity responsible for these goals.

        The Board of Directors will allow others to conduct activities on the Masjid premises that further these goals.
