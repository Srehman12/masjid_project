            <p class="para">Masjid <b>Rehman</b>, which translates to “house of peace mosque” was established as a place
                of worship
                for
                the
                New Tampa Muslims community. The mosque hosts communal prayers for the five daily prayers and the Friday
                sermons. It also features a community hall that is utilized for various programs.</p>


            <div id="onep">
                <p>The mosque exists to bring the community together. It serves as a learning center for people of all
                    faiths to
                    foster a better understanding of Islam. Our doors are always open for all to visit and get to know
                    their
                    Muslim
                    neighbors.</p>
            </div>


            <p class="para">Masjid <b>Rehman</b> is conveniently located on Morris Bridge Road, just north of the
                intersection at
                Cross
                Creek
                Boulevard. It is surrounded by a number of large housing communities and nearly adjacent to a shopping
                plaza
                that features a Publix grocery store. While the mosque is primarily a Muslim place of worship, we invite
                all
                those who are interested in learning about Islam firsthand to visit our mosque and get to know the
                Muslims
                of
                New Tampa.</p>

                large. We draw
                our
                strength and guidance from the Holy Qur`an and the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad, may the peace and
                blessings

            <h2 class="tag">Organization and Goals</h2>

            <p class="para">The Islamic Society Of New Tampa (MR) is the legal entity under which Masjid Rehman
                operates. It is a
                nonprofit
                community organization dedicated to serving the religious, social and educational needs of the local
                Muslim
                American
                community in accordance with the Qur’an and Sunnah.

                We call forth all Muslims to set the highest standard as concerned citizens devoted to ethical behavior
                and
                justice
                for all; ideals that can be achieved by uniting and collectively holding on to the rope of Allah (God
                almighty);
                the
                Qur’an. We recognize that this will entail a constant struggle to become that middle nation, which is
                constantly
                striving to uphold the good whenever it is encountered and forbidding the evil wherever it may reside.

                This, our shared responsibility, is formidable so individually we must dedicate ourselves to becoming
                walking
                talking ambassadors of Islam following in the footsteps of our illustrious Prophet Muhammad (peace be
                upon him).

                At the Islamic Society of New Tampa, we will strive to develop and leverage the collective community
                resources
                to
                launch initiatives that serve the Muslim and the greater non-Muslim community focusing on,

                Promoting Islamic values and principles in accordance with the Qur’an and Sunnah

                Providing religious and community services to the Muslims of New Tampa

                Developing, promoting and distributing educational materials and programs for non-Muslims in the area

                Reaching out and collaborating with local organizations for charitable and good will campaigns designed
                to
                assist
                those in need in the greater Tampa Bay region

                Dedicated Islamic initiation and ongoing mentor-ship and support for new Muslims

                We welcome everyone to visit us, support us, and continually offer constructive ideas to better realize
                our
                united
                vision. Let us not forget that we are all members of the same human fraternity; our differences are
                meant to be
                embraced; our diversity should become our strength if we wholeheartedly commit ourselves to get to know
                each
                other
                because, as Allah has made clear, we are all descendants of one man and one woman.

            <h2 class="tag">MR Vision of Tomorrow</h2>
            <p class="para">
                Our community is growing fast, and the needs of our seniors, adults, families and children are
                expanding.
                Until
                today, Allah SWT has blessed us to meet this demand within our current capacity; however, we have to
                think
                bigger
                and more dynamically as we grow.

                The vision we present is not for the next 5, 10, or even 20 years. It is a change in mindset.

                We would like to share a vision where MR becomes a magnet in our region for a multitude of community
                activities,
                providing an attractive and inspiring place for all ages to help preserve the continuation of our Deen
                for
                generations to come!

                The fresh look of the design of the MR Community Center is inspired by the phrase “New Tampa.” The
                following
                major design objectives were chosen for a long-term sustainable community center:
